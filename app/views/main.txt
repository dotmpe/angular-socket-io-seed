/app/view - Contains all templates.

This is the root from where Express loads its templates.
The typical folders are described in the section below.

Beneath this folder there are also two other levels which have 
other sets of templates.
These do not (normally) include and extend each other but are distinct trees:

/app/view/ng
  - Contains tpls for the complete page(s) with an Angular App.
    These embed directives for a view and one or more controllers.

/app/view/ng/client
  - Contains tpls to build the partial pages used as Angular view.
    These will embed references to one ore more Angular controllers.

Template folder root decription
--------------------------------
Each template folder holds a general structure, 
and is recognized by the layout and include directory::

  layout/
    default
    mobile
  include/ 
  <topic>/
    <topic>
    list
    default
  
Some subnodes are given as informal example.

layout/
  - contains the page configuration extended by a topic
include/
  - contains partials used in a layout

The <topic> folders allow templates for different HTTP endpoint to be organized
according to feature. These can have one or multiple distinct templates
depending on the needs.

Angular pages
--------------
Angular pages can contain one or more apps but only one can be bootstrapped
automatically. 
Each angular page holds a number of controllers, but only one view, which is
loaded from an sepearate URL.
The routing of URL maps to a view URL and controller.

Views can contain their own controllers.

If html5Mode is used with the $locationProvider, there is no hash-URL needed
for client side-routing.
This does tend to create URLs which are not routed at server side.
