The application directory contains server-side scripts, 
sorted to three functions:

- controllers
- models
- views

See views/main.txt for more info on the template tree.

XXX Extension modules should come with config settings, route initializer and an app dir.
  These go to config/config.<module>, config/routes/<module> and app/ext/<module>/?
  
  'node-markdown-mpe' is an try-out for this plugin mechanism.
